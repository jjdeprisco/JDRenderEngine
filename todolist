Potential Enhancements:
  Add more documentation on how to use the timer display.
  Add flexibility to sene blending/transition settings.
  Containerize some of the more complex stuff to tuck it out of the way
  Reduce 2 timers to 1
  Add per-scene PRE-FX pathway (this would be *in addition to* the current PostFX setup)
  Add UI for variables for easier usage.
